Age detection is the process of automatically discerning the age of a person solely from a photo of their face.
Typically, youâ€™ll see age detection implemented as a two-stage process:
Stage 1: Detect faces in the input image/video stream.
Stage 2: And apply the age detector algorithm to predict the age of the person.
